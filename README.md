# ThinkAgain

Social Media and the web have had a substantial positive influence in our lives; the rise of platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook have enabled the ability to communicate quickly and with anyone around the world. The platforms also allow us to creatively express ourselves and share that part with people around the world. 

To every positive element, there are also downsides. As our world becomes more digitalized, distractions in students slowly heighten. I have found that to be very relatable. Whenever I have free time, I find myself mindelessly pressing "command + T (new tab)" and typing "y", which would autofill to the youtube website. Once I'm there, the intriguing and attention-grabbing thumbnails rob me of my time and I find myself in disbelif when I look back at the clock. 

As a solution the ThinkAgain extension replaces a specific image to any social platform you indicate. I will also add a timer that will keep those images replaced until.
